              Here are some of the most common questions we receive from customers.
            </p>
            <h3>Do I have to be there during the move?</h3>
            <p>
                We require that you or a representative be present at all times during your local transfer so that you can assist us. 
                It is your duty to conduct a final walkthrough of the premises to ensure that everything is in working order. Double-check that we've moved everything we're supposed to.
            </p>
            <h3> How do you charge for service?</h3>
            <p>
                Our rates are based on an hourly basis with a 15-minute increment procedure. We have a 3-hour fee minimum scheme.There are no hidden costs in the hourly rates, and they include movers, a fully fitted truck, petrol, tolls, mileage, and basic insurance.
            </p>
            <h3> When and how do I pay?</h3>
            <p>
                Before the work finishes on the day of the transfer, you must pay in full. Cash or credit/debit cards (VISA, MC, Discover, Amex) are accepted. Both credit/debit card purchases are subject to a 3% convenience charge. Since we need a signature on credit/debit card payments, the name on the credit card must match the name on the signature.
            </p>
            <h3> How can I prepare for the move?</h3>
            <p>
                Please clean all drawers in your dresser, file cabinets, and desk. Remember that your furniture will have to be lifted and transported, so it will be more difficult to carry if it is overstuffed and heavy. When moving furniture through difficult obstacles, such as a winding staircase, it's usually safer to remove everything, including the drawers, because it might be necessary to turn the furniture on its side or upside-down to get it through.
